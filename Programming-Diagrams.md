#Programming Diagrams

* Stack diagrams: show the state of the program
* Object diagram: show the attributes of an object and their values
* Class diagram: show the abstract representation of the structure of a program. Examples are HAS-A relationship, IS-A replationship, and dependency relationships.

Both stack and object diagrams represent a snapshot in the execution of a program, so they change as the program runs. A class diagram instead shows individual objects, classes, and relationships between them.
