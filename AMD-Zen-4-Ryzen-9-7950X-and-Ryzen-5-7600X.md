At the end of August 2022, AMD unveiled its Ryzen 7000 series of desktop processors, with four SKUs for the mid-range and high-end market segments. This release is for an entirely new platform, socket AM5. This new release comes with an average of 13% of improved performance mainly coming from the addition of the AVX-512 support. AVX-512 are 512-bit extensions to the 256-bit Advanced Vector Extensions SIMD instructions for x86 instruction set architecture (ISA). 

This CPU comes with improved performance, power-saving features based on based on TSMC's 6nm process, and AMD has even incorporated an entry-level Radeon RDNA2 architecture-based iGPU into the chip.

**The Platform**

The new AM5 platform was designed for the 7000 series chips, meaning that this series of CPUs are not drop-in compatible with existing AMD motherboards. This AM5 platform provides DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 support to improved power management capabilities.

### Differences between the Ryzen 7000 and Ryzen 5000

**Performance Gains**
* TSMC's 5nm process: There is a full node shrink from the 7nm that was used for Ryzen 5000/3000 to now the 5nm process for the Ryzen 7000 series. This reduction in the process node size significantly increases both base and boost frequencies from the Zen 4 architecture. 
* energy efficiency: We see more performance for same amount of energy. Where use 105W TDP for the 7700X with a 700MHz improvement.
* more turbo: Comparing the 7900X and 5900X, we see an increase in TPD from 105W to 170W gives us an increase of 0.8 GHz turbo clocks.
* power-saving features

**Downside**
* no increase in core count: We do not see an increase in core counts at any price point/market segment. This means all performance gains are from architecture and clockspeeds using more silicon. (Which may be a good thing.)
* need liquid cooler with these chips

**New AM5 Socket** 
* a LGA-1718 socket is AMD's first use of the LGA form factor for mainstream desktop CPUs.  
* more headroom which is up to 230W socket power delivery
* longevity of DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 
* the AM5 7000 CPUs will need a cooler and AM4 coolers are compatible with the AM5 platform

###Four new chipsets

AMD has four new chipsets which are the B650 and X670, as well as their "Extreme" variations. 

| | PCIe | Features|
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| B650|PCIe 4.0 for the PEG slot  |less I/O lanes and less flexibility
| B650E| PCIe 5.0 lanes for the PEG slot and support for PCIe 5.0 NVMe storage devices|less I/O lanes and less flexibility
| X670|PCIe 4.0 for the PEG slot | better designs, better controllers, and better specifications
| X670E| PCIe 5.0 lanes for the PEG slot and support for PCIe 5.0 NVMe storage devices|better designs, better controllers, and better specifications



###New I\O Die: TSMC 6nm For Ryzen 7000

The Ryzen 7000 series CPUs are made out of chiplets. The Ryzen 7000 desktop chips are built from an I/O Die (IOD) as well as either one or two core complex dies (CCDs) depending on the SKU. The IOD host all of the PCIe 5.0 lanes, DDR5 integrated memory controller (IMC), and integrated GPU based on AMD's Radeon RDNA2 GPU architecture. The IOD is significant compared to AMD's previous IOD, with AMD implementing several new performance and power-saving features from TSMC's 6nm process. 

This releases by AMD is exciting, now let's see what Intel has to bring to the table!
