#Network Connections

### NIC Properties
* can be viewed through Device Manager
* General, Advanced, Driver, Details, Resources, Power Management tab
* Wake-on-LAN

### Configure Static IP Address on the Wireless Router

The IP addresses that are used within a network uses the following network IP addresses: 
* 10.x.x.x
* 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x
* 192.168.x.x 

Private network IP address ranges are considered to be non-routable and cannot be used on the Internet.
For an IP address to be used on the Internet, it needs to be a public IP address. 

### Wired Network Cards
* Signaling speed
* Duplex settings

### Onbaord Network Adapters
* Built into the motherboard
* Controlled by the chipset
* Device failure considerations

* RSSI: Relative strength signal indicator is where it knows that it needs to hop from access point to another access point. 
* Transmit power: sets the radio signal to the highest power
* SSIDs: service set identifier

### Wireless Network Cards
* Remember IEEE standards
* Roaming aggressiveness
* Transmit power

### Wireless Network Card Settings
* Network Icon
* Network name (SSID)
* Signal Strength: usually measured in bars
* Lock Icon: means we are connected to a secure network

### QoS and Wake-on-LAN
* Quality of Service Packet Scheduler (QoS): a component that provides network traffic control, including rate-of-flow and *prioritization* services. 
* Properties of both wires and wireless network adapters
* QoS (Quality of Service) Packet Scheduler - service bound on the NIC
* Wake-on-LAN - allows the NIC to bring the PC out of a sleep/powered-off state
* Might require a setting in the BIOS/UEFI interface to be configured
