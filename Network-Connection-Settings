#Network Connections

### NIC Properties
* can be viewed through Device Manager
* General, Advanced, Driver, Details, Resources, Power Management tab
* Wake-on-LAN

### Configure Static IP Address on the Wireless Router

The IP addresses that are used within a network uses the following network IP addresses: 
* 10.x.x.x
* 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x
* 192.168.x.x 

Private network IP address ranges are considered to be non-routable and cannot be used on the Internet.
For an IP address to be used on the Internet, it needs to be a public IP address. 

### Wired Network Cards
* Signaling speed
* Duplex settings

### Onbaord Network Adapters
* Built into the motherboard
* Controlled by the chipset
* Device failure considerations

* RSSI: Relative strength signal indicator is where it knows that it needs to hop from access point to another access point. 
* Transmit power: sets the radio signal to the highest power
* SSIDs: service set identifier

### Wireless Network Cards
* Remember IEEE standards
* Roaming aggressiveness
* Transmit power

### Wireless Network Card Settings
* Network Icon
* Network name (SSID)
* Signal Strength: usually measured in bars
* Lock Icon: means we are connected to a secure network

### QoS and Wake-on-LAN
* Quality of Service Packet Scheduler (QoS): a component that provides network traffic control, including rate-of-flow and *prioritization* services. 
* Properties of both wires and wireless network adapters
* QoS (Quality of Service) Packet Scheduler - service bound on the NIC
* Wake-on-LAN - allows the NIC to bring the PC out of a sleep/powered-off state
* Might require a setting in the BIOS/UEFI interface to be configured

# Network Connection Settings Part 2

### Network Connections in Windows 7 and Windows 8
* Network and Sharing Center
* Changing Adapter Settings
* Change Advanced Sharing Settings
* Windows 7(Only) - Network Map
* Windows 7/8 = Homegroups
* Windows 10 does not have Homegroups
* Creating a new network connections, dial-up & VPN connection settings
* Troubleshooting

### Network Connection Settings in Windows 10
* Windows Settings App
* Network & Internet
* Network and Sharing Center Link

### Local Area Connection
* Status, Properties, Diagnose
* Add/configure clients, protocols, services
* Protocol bindings
* View/configure protocol settings

Type of network feature we can install:
* Client: A client provides access to computers and files on the network you are connecting to.
* Service: Service provides network functionalities and protocol such as address formatting and file and printer sharing. 

### IP Address Configuration
* Properties of IPv4 and IPv6
* IP address, subnet mask (IPv4), default gateway, DNS server address
* NetBIOs over TCP/IP is the same as NBT. 

### APIPA Configuration
* APIPA stands for automatic private IP addressing
* Requires a dynamic IP addressing setting
* Viewed from the Alternate Configuration Tab
* Radio button "one-click" configuration
* Enabled by default
* Zero Config
* No gateway, Non-routable
* stateless = I do not have to configure it
* stateful = I have to configure it

### Alternate Configuration
* APIPA Configuration
* Allow for DHCP to be used and statically define alternate IP Address

### Wireless WAN
* 3G/4G transmitter
* Can be integrated, adapter card, USB dongle

### VPN 
* Network and Sharing Center
* Connect to a workplace
* Follow the Network and Center Wizard
* PPP: Point-to-Point Protocol

____

#Perform a Network Reset

* When problems are persistent
* Run the Network Troubleshooter first

###Commandline
* ipconfig /flushdns: flushes the DNS resolver cache
* netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt
* netsh winsock reset: network shell
* netstat allows us to see the status of the TCP/UDP status

###Windows 10
* Settings > Network & Internet > Status > Network Reset

###Device Manager
* Remove all network adapters
* Restart computer
* Windows redetect the network adapters
* Reconfigure network adapters to appropriate configuration parameters

### Viewing TCP/UDP open ports and connections
**netstat**
* -a - displays all the connections and listening ports
* -b - shows the process that has opened the port
* -n - displays ports and addresses in numerical format, speeds up each query.
* -p - chooses which protocol (TCP/UDP)
* -e - Ethernet statistic

### Troubleshooting DNS
**ipconfig**
* /displaydns - view the local DNS resolver cache
* /flushdns - clear the local DNS resolver cache

**nslookup**
* option HostServer
* nslookup -type=mx comptia.org 8.8.8.8
* Non-interactive vs. interactive modes

**dig** - Unix, Linux, MacOS
**MTR** 0 Unix, Linux, MacOS
