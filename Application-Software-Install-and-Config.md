#Application Software Installation and Configuration Methods

###Learning
* Test and resolve OS compatibility issues
* Perform a Network-based installation


###Test and Resolve OS Compatbility Issues
An application may run on a particular version of an OS but may not run on versions of the same OS. So we need to ensure that one of the supported versions of the OS is installed in the machine on which the application is to be installed. We can do this by using the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter wizard in Windows.

###Perform a Network-based Installation

We can install applications by using CDs/DVDs, networks, and the internet. 
* CD/DVD: This method is being phased out because most application development organizations provide a direct download from their Websites.
* Network: The installation files are copied to a shared folder on a server. When a user needs to install an application, the access is granted to the user.
* Internet: Installing applications through the internet is the most preferred method. This can be through the application installer and installation key. 

###Facts
* The RAM and Free Disk Space must be checked in the system before installing an application.
* We can access RAM related information inside System settings.
* The OS architecture, manufacturer, and version is a factor in deciding the compatibility of an OS.
