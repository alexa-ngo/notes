###NTFS gives us:
* ACL (Access Control List) has ACE (Access Control Entry)
* permissions
* journal file system
* compression
* encryption

###NTFS File and Folder Permissions
* NTFS permissions always apply
* Shared permissions are applied when accessing a shared resource
* Permissions apply to the root directory and then propagate to all subdirectories
* When applying folder permissions, remember propagation
