# Malware Prevention

1. Recovery console
2. Use backup and restore. This can be because of:
    * hard drive failure
    * virus attacks
    * accidental or unintentional deletion

3. Educate the end user of:
    * social engineering
    * password protection
    * device security
    * physical security
4. Malware is software designed to harm to system. Malware can cause:
    * system lockups
    * slowness
    * application crashes
    * applications generating unexpected output
5. Ransomware locks the system. Three key types of ransomware are: 
    * scareware: pop-ups tell the user their system is infected with malware and must pay to remove the malware
    * screen lockers
    * encrypting ransomware: the user must pay ransom for decrypting the data and the payment is usually demanded in cryptocurrency. 
6. Trojan is malware that gives unauthorized access to the system in the form of a legitimate application. The most commonly used types of trojans are:
    * backdoor: creates a backdoor entry in a system
    * exploit: targets the vulnerabilities of an application or the operating system
    * rootkit: designed to hide the malicious codes or activities within a system so they can not be tracked. 
7. Virus is a piece of code that cause changes to the way an application behaves. Viruses can:  
    * steal data
    * steal passwords
    * perform keystroke logging
    * delete data
    * send span e-mails to contacts
8. Botnet is a network of trojan infected computers. The computers are infected by the attackers such as Distributed Denial-of-Service attackers (DDoS). The systems in a botnet are known as bots, and are connected to the master server. The owner of the botnet can perform the DDoS attack to: 
    * bring down servers and Websites
    * spam millions of users on the Internet
    * display banner ads in the Web browser of the user to target them

    **Not all botnets are malicious.** They can be used for good purposes such as Relay Chat.
9. The worm is a piece of malicious software that can duplicate itself on one or more networked systems. Worms could reside on a system or traverse over a network. If there are too many worms existing on a system, it could impact the performance parameters of the system. If the worms were traveling over the network, it would consume the bandwidth of that network. Worms do not perform any malicious activities, but their presence in large quantities affects the system and or network performance.
9. Spyware spies on the user behavior or data. This means our data, credit card information, authentication information could be leaked. Spyware could be sent to the system of the user along with legitimate software. The purpose of spyware is to gather confidential information such as passwords.
