1. Core i7 or i9 (at least P series, H is preferable) 12th gen - I don't mind a Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9 6000 series CPU too... I think minimum I prefer is H/HX - Please pay attention to the number of cores. I would like at least 8 cores, 16 threads total
2. Minimum 16 GB of RAM, DDR4 or DDR5 is okay. But preferable that the RAM is expandable. (2 slots) - Otherwise, if not expandable, then 32-64 GB
3. No need for video card. Intel Xe is good enough (integrated)
4. Ports can be simple. Just enough USB ports, and ideally something I can hook a monitor to. FYI most USB-C ports can connect to a monitor nowadays... I don't mind not having USB-A because I can get a YubiKey for USB-C
5. I don't mind not having HDMI, DP, etc. I can plug monitor through USB-C
6. 14-16" screen is good. I prefer to have something at least 2560x1440 resolution, and definitely 400+ nits. IPS panel (but I think screens at this level are IPS already)
7. At least 1 TB storage (nvme drive)
8. I don't care about the weight. This will be mostly stationary and occasionally on couch when I have to watch Riley
9. Battery life is not that important to me. Most laptops nowadays have decent battery life.

Around $2000-$2500 is the budget. I actually don't want to spend more than I have to.
