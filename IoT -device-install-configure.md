#IoT Devices

* Global network of personal devices
* Devices pass data between one another
* Called M2M communications: machine to machine

###IoT Wireless Networking Technologies
* Bluetooth and Low Energy
* Bluetooth 1.x = 1 Mbps
* Bluetooth 2.x = 3 Mbps
    * Features Enabled Data Rate (EDR)
    * EDR allows for faster speeds
* Bluetooth 3.x = 24 Mbps
    * Features High Speed or Bluetooth 3.0 + HS
* Bluetooth 4.x = 24 Mbps
    * Features collecting data from Low Energy (LE) devices
    * Small battery-power devices
* Bluetooth range is around 10m/30ft 

### Z-Wave
* Communication protocol for home automation
* Certificate program
* Uses a mesh network topology
* Low energy radio waves
    * 800-900 MHz range
    * Less congestion
* Maximum devices = 232
* AES-128 encryption standard (symmetrical key encryption)

###ZigBee
* similar to Z-Wave
* Open-source competitor
* Certificate program 
* 2.4 GHz, 8 MHz, 9 MHz; 2.4 GHz is for the commercial frequency
* AES-128 encryption 
* 64 devices

### RFID 
* tagging and tracking objects
* can use a tagging system
* tags can be powered or unpowered
* unpowered tags = 25m range
* powered tags = 100m range


* Networking protocol is the same ()
