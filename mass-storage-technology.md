#Mass Storage Technologies

###Hybrid hard drives (HHDs)
* Hybrid hard drives (HHDs) are drives that combine flash memory and spinning platters that provide fast and reliable storage. HHDs are also known as SSHDs.
* Apple computers uses a Fusion Drive which offers the same concept as a hybrid hard drive. 

###Connecting Mass Storage

###SATA and PATA:

###PATA
* PATA drives usesd unique 40-pin ribbon cables called **IDE cables**.
* The last ATA/ATAPI standard that addressed PATA provided support for very large hard drives(144 petabytpe[PB], more than 144 million gigabytes) at speeds up to 133 megabytpes per second (MBps).
* A single PATA ribbon cable could connect up to two PATA drives to a single ATA controller. This connects hard drives, optical drives, and tape drives. We can set jumpers on the drives to make one master and the other slave. 
* ATA/ATAPI version 3 introduced **S.M.A.R.T** (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) which is an internal drive program that tracks errors and error corrections within the drive. S.M.A.R.T software will help create a baseline of hard drive functionality to predict potential drive failures. 

####Issues with PATA
* 1. Flat ribbon cables impeded airflow
* 2. Cables had a limited length of 18 inches
* 3. PATA drives are not hot-swappable
